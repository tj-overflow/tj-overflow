# Hi, I'm Taejun Oh

**Computational Economist | AI Systems Architect**

I engineer **autonomous economic agents**. My work bridges the gap between **Economic Theory** (Game Theory, Mechanism Design) and **Artificial Intelligence**, building systems that reason, negotiate, and optimize under incomplete information.

- **Current Focus**: Developing **AlphaNegotiator (Procurement Sentinel)** — A decision engine for autonomous B2B negotiation.
- **Core Research**: Opponent Modeling, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), and Search Algorithms (MCTS) applied to Economic Games.
- **Academic Focus**: Applied Machine Learning, NLP, and Advanced Bayesian Modeling (Spring 2026).
