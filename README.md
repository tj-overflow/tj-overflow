# Hi, I'm Taejun Oh

**Computational Economist & Systems Architect in Training**

I am bridging the gap between **Economic Theory** (Game Theory, Mechanism Design) and **Artificial Intelligence**. My work focuses on building computational systems that solve complex problems in finance and economics, moving beyond traditional econometrics to apply modern engineering principles.

- **Currently working on**: Foundational Computer Science (Distributed Systems, Parallel Programming)
- **Currently studying**: Master of Computer Science at UIUC
- **Interests**: Causal Inference, Algorithmic Game Theory, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
